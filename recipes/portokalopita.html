        This recipe is sourced from MyGreekDish.com, which I found through Beryl Shereshewsky's YouTube Channel. This is a delicious and incredibly easy recipe using phyllo dough and homemade orange syrup. It's incredible how the whole thing comes together fairly quickly, but the payoff is much more than the effort put in. It's delicious, sweet, light and super easy.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the Syrup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400mL water</li>
            <li>400mL sugar</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 orange, in big ribbons (I use a peeler)</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Batter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>300mL vegetable oil</li>
            <li>300mL granulated sugar</li>
            <li>300mL freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>4t baking powder</li>
            <li>Zest from 1 1/2 oranges, microplaned</li>
            <li>1t vanilla extract</li>
            <li>16oz package of phyllo dough</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350f. Unwrap phyllo dough and lay out on a baking sheet to defrost and dry out. The phyllo should be sufficiently dried out after 30 minutes in room temperature</li>
            <li>In a pot, add all syrup ingredinets together and place on medium heat until simmering. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and syrup has thickened, 5-10 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add vegetable oil, sugar and eggs and whisk until combined. Add yogurt, orange juice and zest, and vanilla and whisk until mixture is homogenous. Stir in baking powder.</li>
            <li>Crumble dried out phyllo dough into small pieces. Add gradually into the orange juice/yogurt mixture, making sure that all pieces of phyllo are wet before adding in the next handful.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into a greased 8x12in or similar sized dish. Place in the center of a 350f oven for 40-50 minutes, until lightly golden on top and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Once cake is cooked through, take out of the oven. Ladle cooled syrup over the hot cake, allowing each ladleful to absorb before adding the next one. Once syrup has been ladled over, let cake come to room temperature before sticking into the fridge. Serve cake cold.</li>
        </ol>
