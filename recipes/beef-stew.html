        <p>This is the All American Beef Stew by Kenji Lopez-Alt, originally published in his SeriousEats.com series The Food Lab. The recipe is complicated, but incredibly satisfying and rich. This dish is best served atop mashed potatoes, polenta or rice. Searing the meat adds some fond to the bottom of the pot, which results in additional depth of flavor for little to no effort. The tomato paste and anchovies add umami to the dish, and the gelatin adds some much-needed body that isn't present if, like me, you use storebought stock.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4c (950mL) chicken stock</li>

            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>10oz (275g) white button mushrooms, quartered</li>
            <li>4 medium carrots (about 275g), 2 left whole and 2 cut into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, unpeeled, split in half</li>
            <li>2 small ribs celery (about 85g)</li>
            <li>3 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled</li>
            <li>1c red wine</li>
            <li>2T AP flour</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>4 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>1lb potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300f and reposition rack to the bottom position. Combine first six ingredients with a blender until homogenous</li>
            <li>Season beef with S+P, then sear in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Transfer to plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add mushrooms to the Dutch oven, cook until liquid is released and mushroom is browning. Add diced carrots and cook until all well browned. Season to taste with S+P. Transfer to bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion halves to the Dutch oven, cut side down. Add whole carrots, celery stalks and garlic. Cook until well browned.</li>
            <li>Add wine and deglaze the bottom with a wooden spoon until all browned bits are scraped up. Reduce by 3/4. Add broth mixture, bay leaf, thyme and accumulated beef juices. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Cut seared steaks into large cubes (they will shrink slightly while cooking, so cut larger than bite-sized). Toss with flour.</li>
            <li>Place Dutch oven back on medium heat. Add beef and return mixture to a simmer. Transfer to oven and cover with the lid partially open. Cook for about 1.5 hours, until beef is starting to become tender.</li>
            <li>Remove stew from the oven. Fish out the carrots, celery, thyme, bay elaf, onion and garlic. Add potatoes and mushroom mixture. Return stew to oven, partially covered, until beef potatoes and carrots are tender and broth has thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove stew from oven. Place over a burner and reduce to desired consistency if necessary. Season to taste and serve.</li>
        </ol>
