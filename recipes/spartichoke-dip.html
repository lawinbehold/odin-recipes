        This is a four-cheese Spinach and Artichoke Dip recipe from SpendWithPennies.com. This dish is flavorful and a hit at parties and potlucks. This can be made ahead and reheated im the oven shortly before serving.
        The dip can be served with the bread and/or chip of your choice. My personal favorite to have with this dip is pita chips.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>2/3c sour cream</li>
            <li>1/3c mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1.5c mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1/2c freshly shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2c shredded gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>10oz frozen chopped spinach, defrosted</li>
            <li>14 oz artichoke hearts, chopped</li>
            <li>Chip or bread of your choice for dipping</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375f</li>
            <li>Get your ingredients in order: grate your cheeses, mince your garlic, chop your artichoke hearts. Squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the defrosted spinach, picking out any tough bits you may feel. This won't feel nice in the finished product so you may as well get rid of them now</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients and mix with a hand mixer until aerated and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella, the rest of the cheeses, and the spinach and artichokes. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a baking dish and top with remaining mozzarella.</li>
            <li>At this point you can top with cayenne pepper, smoked paprika or other flavorings tha you want. If prepping ahead, this can be covered and stored in the fridge at this step.></li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes until bubbly and top is browned. If baking from the fridge it may need more time.</li>
            <li>Let cool from 15 minutes to allow for dip to set to the correct consistency. Top with a bit of chopped parsley if desired. Serve while hot.</li>
        </ol>
