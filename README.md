This is an exercise on setting up a basic recipe HTML website on GitHub. 

Two hours later - I practiced all pieces I learned of Git, GitHub and HTML through The Odin Project:
    Created a new directory using GitHub that I loaded onto my local device.
    Used Git to navigate around the directory above.
    Used VSC and HTML to create simple webpages of recipes I love.
        Recipe pages use links, images(and alt text), headings, ordered and unordered lists. Strong and emphasis were not used.
